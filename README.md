# Molecular-Property-Prediction
Project on prediction of molecular properties i.e. scalar coupling constant based on <br>
  1. nearby molecular positions given by one dimensional two dimensional coordinates.
  2. Implemented using linear regression and tuned model using xgboost<br>
 
Data obtained from active competition under kaggle <br>
